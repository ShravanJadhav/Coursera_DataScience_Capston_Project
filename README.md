# 🚀 Space Launch Company: Data Science Capstone Project

Welcome to the Data Science Capstone Project! In this project, I take on the role of a Data Scientist for a private space launch company. This repository contains all the steps, code, and deliverables from the end-to-end data science workflow — from data collection to building predictive models and communicating insights.

## 📂 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧪 Data Collection
- Collected raw data from various sources relevant to space launches, including APIs, public datasets, and internal databases.
- Sources may include historical launch records, weather data, satellite telemetry, and more.

### 2. 🧹 Data Wrangling
- Cleaned and transformed raw data to improve quality.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and noise.

### 3. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the structure and distribution of data.
- Identified patterns and relationships using statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Applied grouping techniques using categorical variables to explore data more granularly.

### 4. 🧮 SQL-Based Data Exploration
- Queried structured data using SQL to extract insights and perform transformations.
- Performed joins, aggregations, filtering, and window functions for deeper analysis.

### 5. 📊 Statistical Analysis & Visualization
- Applied basic statistical techniques to understand correlation and significance between variables.
- Used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visual insights.

### 6. 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- Built, evaluated, and refined machine learning models to make predictions.
- Tasks may include predicting launch success, estimating fuel needs, or forecasting weather impact.

### 7. 🎯 Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R², and classification accuracy.
- Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

### 8. 📝 Final Presentation & Storytelling
- Crafted a compelling story around the analysis using visualizations and findings.
- Created a professional presentation to communicate insights to stakeholders.
